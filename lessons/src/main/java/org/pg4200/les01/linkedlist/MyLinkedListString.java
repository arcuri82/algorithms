        /*
            Here we did modify the the "tail", but not the "head". Why?
            Wouldn't "head.next" always be null, and so the list will have
            at most 1 element?

            The point is that you need to remember that object references are just
            pointers to location in memory.
            So, after the first element has been added, before we add a new "node" we have

            Memory | Variable | Pointer to Heap
            x      | head     | k
            y      | tail     | k
            z      | node     | q

            Memory  | Next
            k       | null
            q       | null


            The operation on "tail.next = node" would NOT change the current
            values of the references in this method, as no head/tail/node is modified.
            The heap is modified though into:

            Memory  | Next
            k       | q
            q       | null

            ie, "tail.next" means go to the object in the heap at position "k" and, there,
            with "=node" replace the value of the variable "next" with the pointer of the
            object "node" (which we can see that points to "q").

            Note, however, that both "head" and "tail" are still both pointing to the same "k".
            So, "head.next" is not null, but pointing to "q"

            The final step "tail = node" does the last change on the stack, so finally:

            Memory | Variable | Pointer to Heap
            x      | head     | k
            y      | tail     | q
            z      | node     | q

            Memory  | Next
            k       | q
            q       | null

            After this method is completed, the reference to "node" is discarded, as it lived
            on the method call stack trace, ie the slot at "z" is freed and can be recycled.

    /*
        How does this implementation differ from the "naive" one?
        Now, both "size()"  and "add()" are much quicker, as they do
        not need "while" loops to iterate over all the elements starting
        from the head.
        The "get()" is still the same though.
