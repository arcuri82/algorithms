        The Java API provides many implementations for containers, eg in
        the "java.util.*" package.
        It is unlikely that you will ever need to implement your own containers,
        as we do here in this course.
        The point is that, to properly choose which container to use, you need
        to understand how they work internally.

        Technically, to fulfil the contract of the StringContainerWithIndex interface,
        I could use internally an actual list from the Java API, and "delegate" all the
        methods on such list.

        It is technically correct, although quite pointless: why not using the Java API directly?
        In the exercises in this course (and the exam), you are NOT allowed to write this kind
        of delegate code, unless otherwise specified.
        Even worse, do NOT do it in a job interview...
        Note: we will looking into "Generics" (eg, "<String>") next class.
