/**
 * In most programs, we need to store data, and then being able to retrieve it later on.
 * For example, we could need to store info about which items we selected in a shopping cart (eg Amazon),
 * preferred songs in a play list, etc.
 *
 * Why using an interface? Because there can be many different ways to implement such functionalities, but
 * for the client that uses such class, the implementation details are not important from the functionality
 * point of view.
 * But then, why having different implementations?
 * Reason: PERFORMANCE!!!
 * Based on how it is implemented, each operation will have a different cost (e.g., running time
 * and memory consumption).
 * So when you choose a specific implementation to use, such choice would be based
 * on which operations are expected to be used most.
 *
 * There are different kinds of containers. Containers in which stored elements are laid
 * out in a precise, consecutive order are usually called "List".
 *
 * A container could contain different kinds of data, e.g., strings, numbers, song objects, etc.
 * For now, we just consider storing String objects.
 *
 * For the moment, we do not handle yet the more complex functionality of deleting elements
 * and insertions at any position in the list
