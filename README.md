# Algorithms and Data Structures

![CI](https://github.com/arcuri82/algorithms/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

Slides, code examples and exercises (with solutions) for the PG4200 course: 
Algoritmer og datastrukturer (Algorithms and Data Structures).
This course is taught at Kristiania University College, Oslo, Norway.

There are plenty of resources online to learn about algorithms and data structures in Java.
However, one key aspect in this course is a strong emphasis on software testing.
Furthermore, the _math_ is kept to a minimum, whereas more focus is given to the practical 
usages of the algorithms.

## Code

The code is written in Java, and it is divided into 3 Maven modules:
* `/lessons`: code for each lesson, divided into one package per lesson.
* `/exercises`: starting code used in some of the exercises (when applicable). 
* `/solutions`: code of the solutions of the exercises.
